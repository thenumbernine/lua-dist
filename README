Distribution for lua projects
In OSX this makes an .app
In Windows this makes a folder with a run.bat
That's all I've got for now.  maybe an Android version will come someday, based on the jni SDL + luajit build of android.

usage: lua -ldist

requires a distinfo file

distinfo contains the following:

name = name of project

luaArgs = lua args, or
	table of platform-specific lua args, with the first entry being the default,
	'win' being the windows-specific args
	'osx' being the OSX-specific args
files = key/value map where the keys is the base directory and the values are what files to copy
	all directory structure other than the base is preserved in the copy
	copes from base/file to dist/data/directory/file

luajitLibs = table of luajit libs to use, with platform-specific overrides similar to luaArgs
